I am doing my Ph.D. in __Deep Learning__ at the Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Group Lab at __Technical University of Cluj-Napoca__, advised by Prof. Sergiu Nedevschi. My research focuses on __Extending the Generalization Capability  of Deep Neural Networks__.

I got my __Bachelor's__ degree in Computer Engineering from TUCN in 2019, where I have worked on improving a Structure from Motion pipeline by enforcing semantic constraints. The method was tested in the case of drone navigation.

In the fall of 2019 I have moved to Oulu, Finland, where I have started my __Master's__ degree at University of Oulu, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, I have started working at VTT Technical Research Center of Finland as a research trainee. For my Master's thesis, we have analyzed the feasibility of utilizing Deep Neural Networks for estimating particles size distribution in mineral slurry. The work was part of jointly funded project [APASSI](https://www.photonics.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/APASSI-project-FCA-PREIN-webinar-10-06-2021-v1.pdf). 

I have continued working at VTT as Research Scientist, focusing on Machine Vision for industrial solution. I have worked in domains such as agriculture, plastics, defense and medical imaging. Another cool (and public) work I've done at VTT can be found in the [AHMED report](https://www.regops.fi/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AHMED_final-report.pdf), where we proposed a MLOps framework for developing AI/ML solutions for medical devices.

In 2023 I have quit my job and travelled to South America on my motorcycle, fullfiling one of my life-long dreams. A blog about those adventures will be soon out.

Also from 2023 I have been involved in the [BrightR](https://brightr.ro/) startup, which does digital dental shade matching.
